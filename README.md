Text Classification: Use pre-trained models like BERT to classify text into categories, e.g., sentiment analysis or spam detection.

Text Summarization: Summarize long texts automatically using models like BART or T5.

Text Generation: Generate text based on prompts with GPT-2/3, useful for dialogue, stories, or code completion.

Image Classification: Classify images into categories using models like Vision Transformers (ViT) or ResNet.

Object Detection: Detect and locate objects in images with models like DETR for tasks like security or image analysis.

Each task can be implemented efficiently with Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers or Datasets libraries, making it easy to fine-tune models for specific use cases.
